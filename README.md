## License

See `.txt` files associated with each map for the license.

All maps in the `redeclipse/` and `tesseract/` folders are under free culture
Creative Commons licenses (with commercial use and modification allowed).
In those folders, CC BY-SA is the strictest license used, although some maps
are under CC BY or CC0 instead.

**Warning:** Some maps in the `sauerbraten/` folder use Creative Commons licenses
that disallow commercial use. Still, modification is allowed as maps that use a
no-derivatives license were excluded from this set.
