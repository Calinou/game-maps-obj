# Game maps as OBJ meshes

This repository contains various OBJ files exported from
[Sauerbraten](https://sauerbraten.org), [Red Eclipse](https://www.redeclipse.net)
and [Tesseract](https://tesseract.gg). These maps were exported using the
`/writeobj <destination>` command after loading the map in the game.
