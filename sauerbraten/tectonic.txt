Medium-sized CTF map located at a volcanic island

The map is located on a desolate island containing a rather disturbing volcano that is about to errupt. There was a small, not too well-maintanded town here, however it was anabonded in a hurry as soon as the first earthquake came.
Now, the first lava streams are already pouring out of the crater and the air is fogged with dust and ash. The wind is rising and an ominous thunder can be heard from the heart of the rock...

Tectonic is a symmetrical medium-sized CTF map. It is based around a volcano on an island. The flags are located in castle-like buildings. One of the path leading from the flag castle leads to a big open cave that looks like it has been used for storage while the other goes into a small valley. One of the two side paths leads onto a cliff side, the other leads into the cave. There are also two staircases that lead to the shore. One side of the shore is desolate and unhabitated while the other has plenty of houses and raised coast for easier access to docked ships.

This map uses a lot of sounds to create atmosphere. Please turn off Sauerbraten music for better experience.
