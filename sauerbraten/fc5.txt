"FANTASY CASTLE 5" MAP FOR SAUERBRATEN
by Blindabuser and PainKillAH - 03.06.2010
------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION:

Sauerbraten (a.k.a. Cube 2) is a free multiplayer/singleplayer first
person shooter, conceived, made and released by Wouter van Oortmerssen
and Lee "Eihrul" Salzman, available for download at: sauerbraten.org.
This map file is a little contribute to extend the original game.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION:

This is the fifth installment of my "Fantasy Castle" series, probably
the largest and most detailed, maybe the last I'll make on this theme.
I've worked for two months in my spare time, in order to achieve these
results (hopefully decent) with the main goal of making this map as
much enjoyable as possible for almost all tastes. It's suitable for ffa,
instagib, ctf and capture game modes. Due to its detail and extent, it
requires a rather powerful computer, even though all the possible means
to reduce its impact on performances have been attempted (lightprecision
128, PVS, texture-blending, etc.) Note: there are few "secret" teleports 
leading to the highest parts of the map (for the joy of snipers, and
probable complaints of some "rule-bound" players. Enjoy! ;)
