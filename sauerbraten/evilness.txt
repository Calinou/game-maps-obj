I would like to present a capture the flag map, Evilness!
After spending over a year on this map (with a break at the 30-day-mapping challenge of course), I finally managed releasing this map to the public.

Content Information
The theme, well the map actually had several separate themes, since it contained 2 bases which carry both a gothic-like layout, while the centre of the map was a small town. But as some comments have given me some suggestions (which are quite logical), I deleted the "odd" looking town (sometimes a design can be improved by going back to one of it's earlier stages and build up from that position again).

The map has pretty much features which any (un)official maps don't have (from the custom shader on the teleports, till even the so called "jumpcurve").
When I started creating this map, I was convinced the flow and gameplay should stand above any other point, that's why I've spend most of the time on that.
It has several original parts in it, like the jumppad-curves to reach the flag, but also the teleport system from base to base and the geometry of the map.
It's designed to be played on any capture the flag mode, doesn't matter which. Every path from flag to flag takes between 10 and 15 seconds, if you wouldn't meet any opponent. After some previous updates, modes like deathmatch (not recommended though), capture or hold can be played as well. I would recommend the amount of players from 10 up to 18, since there are a lot of pickups spawning on the map, but getting camped on a playerstart isn't much to worry about either (since there are fairly enough of them, spread out in each base).
The gameplay is designed on such way that if you just have a bad aiming but like to sneak up opponents from behind or you're the type of player which has a clear mind and great aiming, there's fun for everyone.

Just travel trough the map a while and you'll definitely feel how much time and care has been spend in it. Feel free to leave a comment!

Sidenotes
Since the screenshot isn't very clear to me (because of the low resolution allowed on quadropolis), here's a better view of the map.

Because the map contains a lot of custom textures and models, please notify me (like posting a comment on this content) which textures or model isn't getting loaded/looking odd.

License notifications
I would like to thank Yves Allaire for the great textures, Barry Collins for the Dissonance models and all people who commented about the map and/or gave me advices which leaded to this result.

What more to do
- Nothing where I'm aware of, be sure to comment if you still think something should be improved!

Improvements
29th of September 2011
- Improved the lighting of the red base and the building in the hearth of the centre inside the town (the blue base will come soon).
- Added the quaddamage which was disappeared after mirroring some months ago.
- Temporary waypoints are added (those of Calinou. I still would thank him for his work).

30th of September 2011
- Improved the lighting of the blue base also.
- Updated the screenshot
- Whipped out the texture errors. It should fully work now.

2nd of October 2011
- Added sounds. I'm not sure if I'll keep the wind sound like this, but for now, it will do.
- Fixed some clutter which appeared after copy-pasting some mapmodels (like double flags -.-).

8th of October 2011
- Deleted the town. It decreased the wtr to 90k, which actually isn't much for such size.
- Took a step aside from the night-theme and made a day-light themed map of it, with combination of the great "Devil's PunchBowl Skybox" made by Sock. The rest of the lighting still needs to be adjusted to the other light, but it's a start.
- Cleaned up the textures and models which aren't necessary anymore.

9th of October 2011
- Added bases and playerstarts for mode-groups like deathmatch, capture and hold (there should be 62 playerstarts now).
- Improved the lighting by reducing the radius of several lights on lamps.
- Fixed some texture mistakes (like the crates in each cave).
- Increased the volume of some sounds.
- Added a demo-file of "how the jumpcurve should be taken", for the people who desperately need to check out with their own eyes (press ingame "/demo evilness_tutorial_9oct11"). Beware! This is made with the justice edition, so may not be supported for SVN version.

10th of October 2011
- Improved the lighting by using the "sunlight" command in SVN version.

13th of October 2011
- Added more details to the map so it looks more "broken". It's still only at the red base, but the blue side of the map will get them soon either.
- Added a way to the YA to make it also "accessible" for bots.

14th of October 2011
- Added details to the blue base also, still needs some more.
- Repositioned some bases.
- Included the demo-file again.
- Used SVN version to lower the wtr to only 63k(!) because of the improved remipping. Thank you eihrul (and other programmers) for that any many more features (and also the engine itself of course)!

15th of October 2011
- Fixed some lighting issues and improved the lighting.
- Fixed some more mistakes of texturing.
- Updated screenshots.

17th of October 2011
- Got rid of the caves and let the middle jumpcurve come out right into the courtyard of each base.
- Replace the middle teleports for a fairly small room to let players battle for the quad which spawns in it (yes, the quad has been replaced again). A single "cap" takes now at least 20 seconds, exclusive enemy fire.
- Fixed some small edit-mistakes.

18th of October 2011
- Finished the centre of the map, added teleports to the catwalk again (since they are intended to surprise people who are camping on the entrance to the centre).
- Improved the flow by repositioning some boxes and clipping some parts of it.
- Deleted several textures in the zip-file which have left their purpose.

16th of December 2011
- Replaced the skybox and positioned different.
- Changed the position of the sunlight and it's colour (should look way better now).
- Added fogdome so the skybox fits the theme (looks way more evil now).
- Cleaned up the zip-file a little bit, as it was still including some unnecessary textures.
- Experimented with PVS culling. This feature will be added in some of it's next releases, as it can save up like 10 frames per second on this map.
- Changed the lighting in the centre of the map, so both teleports are more recognizable to the position of the teledests.

21th of December 2011
- Tweaked the lighting some more. It should be fine now. I'll probably can't get it any better on my own.
- Completed the waypoints. Every accessible area should be waypointed now.

24th of December 2011
- Added more details on the stairways.
- Completed the waypoints, it should be fully waypointed now.
- Fixed some nasty clipping, geometry and some lighting mistakes.
Sidenote:
After testing the map with bots of a high skill, I noticed there are pretty much places where you have just enough space to put a shot between pillars and doorways. It seems the map would be great to train your timing of shooting when strafing away from your cover. Of course there seems to be areas which this isn't really counting, but they seem to be tactical on another way though (like standing higher or lower than your opponent).

28th of December 2011
- Finished adding details on the stairways.
- Improved clipping for saving up file-size on the PVS-Culling part. The culling still saves up like 10 frames per second on open areas, while saving up like 5 frames on less open areas.
- Improved lighting, as some doorways where unlighted (while they should).
- Added more details to the map and some more textures as well.
- Added a decal-texture for creating a more realistic look (on the quad and both flags).
- Fixed some texture, geometry and clipping mistakes.

30th of December 2011
- Cleaned up the cloudbox which was unnecessary
- Added some more textures again
- Updated the screenshots

31th of December 2011
- Added some textures to the zip-file which were deleted because they weren't having any purpose in one of the previous releases (while they do now again).
- Added PVS-Culling again (wasn't available in previous update).

3th of January 2012
- Added more details like blendmaps, which are presenting blood of several corpses.

4th of January 2012
- Added even more details like blendmaps (at the skeletons).
- Added sounds to the skeletons and fans.
- Changed the lighting a bit.
- Tweaked the pickup placement a little bit, by adding 2 grenades in the centre of the map, while replacing one 1 of the grenades next to the statues for riflerounds.

6th of January 2012
- Changed all light-entities. All orange lights has been replaced for more fancy red lights which almost though to pink. All light-blue lights has been replaced for more purple-blue light.
- Saved up 2k of wtr by putting skytexture on geometry which is on top of the map (usually not sightable for players).
- Added more details on the walls, as hanged corpses (this time, just from raw geometry instead).
- Changed the grenades at the quad for cartridges, to prevent players would use the grenades for keeping the any other player away from the quad. Not sure if I'll put this back again as it's a pretty tactical option.
- Cleaned up the entire packaging, saved up around 1,2Mb!

7th of January 2012
- Added another mapmodel (I know, bad guy but it just fits the theme that good and isn't being a very file-size consuming model after all).
- Fixed some forgotten light-entities.
- Wondering to delete the PVS-culling part again, as it takes about 0,4Mb of the file-size. Any suggestion would be great.
- Updated the screenshot, it now also shows parts of the red base.

16th of January 2012
- Replaced the ugly looking rooms which launches players to a spiral staircase, for caves.
- Optimized the lightmaps and geometry by skytexturing all geometry which is in sight of players.

22th of January 2012
- Cutted down the pillar in the middle of the quad-room. This makes the flow suffer a little bit, but increases the gameplay greatly (as bots won't go wild anymore after seeing just a tiny part of an opponent).
- Updated waypoints.
- Tested the map carefully and till now, the map is just as I wanted to be. If you find anything which you think that shouldn't be like that gameplay- or flow-wise, please comment about it.
- Checked for any license issues. All should have been fixed now (as the Dissonance models should have been licensed correctly now, as well as the fan-model).
- Deleted the imperium model and made an own stature from raw geometry.

28th of January 2012
- After many attempts tracking the original creator of the dissonance models, I finally managed to contact him (thanks eihrul). License is included in the same folder as the models.
- Skytextured all geometry now, as I forgot 1 side of some mountains.
- Replaced the custom shader for texscroll and alpha-material, as it provides errors when a player is rendering in glsl only (isn't crashing Sauerbraten. The texture just gets displayed with the nearest glow-mapped texture, which looks odd).
- Added even more details to the map.

29th of January 2012
- Made the last fixes with co-operation of Razgriz aka "The Bug-tracer" on skytexturing. The map is currently only 57k of wtr and the content just 10,7Mb inclusive textures!
- Added another layer of clip-material on the clipping-ceiling.

4th of February 2012
- Changed the configuration-files of the Dissonance models, to solve an appearance bug.

5th of February 2012
- Improved the hanging corpses as they were looking like t-shirt and some trousers.
