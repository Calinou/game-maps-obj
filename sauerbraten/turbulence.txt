This is a sci-fi styled CTF map I've had in the works for quite a while; the first layout was actually made over a year ago, and it's been sitting there 90% finished for six months. Well I finally got the lighting half decent, and I'm sick of working on it so tonight it gets uploaded. The working title was "aero", but I can't think of a good name atm so I'm just calling it turbulence. Please leave a review, feedback, etc. Thanks!
