I would like to give credit to maps like konkuri-to and sacrifice for inspiring the look of this map.

For those who care, lore for both sides of the map:

The display diorama at the top of red side is a nod to the story of icarus, who flew too close to the sun, the red warlock harnessed the power of captive stars
for his magics but couldn't tolerate the side effects and died by fire.
he burned the tree he lay under with only a raven as witness to his end.

Blue side tells the story of the two mages who conspired to use unnatural magics that drew from the earth for power, until their magic made the ground infertile, and poisoned the water, they both died of starvation under a conjoined tree.
The conjoined tree represents how the two mages became a sum of evil through their act of corrupting their environment.
